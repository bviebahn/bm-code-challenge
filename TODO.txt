Here is a simple react app for loyalty program customers, which should show special catalog prices for the plus customers.

TODO:

1. Handle plus customer login with password (check password and save customer status in persistent storage)
2. Customize product component to show a special price (plus customers only)
3. Bonus: Implement add to cart functionality based on app state management library
4. What would you make another or better in this app?
